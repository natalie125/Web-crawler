This project involves the development of a web crawler and search tool designed to index and rank pages from a specified website. Using Python, the tool crawls pages, builds an inverted index of words, and records the positions and connectivity of each page. The inverted index, built with Beautiful Soup and the Requests library, maps words to their locations across pages and supports search queries with a ranking algorithm. The tool ranks pages based on term frequency, position in text, and PageRank to highlight the most relevant results. The PageRank calculation uses link analysis and a damping factor to assess the link-based importance of each page.
